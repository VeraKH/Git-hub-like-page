# JClass-page

Layout for this web-page was created from zero without any templates and only with the power of HTML and CSS. Icons only were borrowed from the external web services. As a visual sample I took Github user's profile page. So find the differences :)

I also practice JavaScript on this page, and be careful - you might find there annoying questions and quizzes while clicking some links. Likely, nothing of that goes to the server - feel free to ignore it! All JavaScript functions were written by me - they are not elegant and with tons of variables but they work.

#Problems solving and bugs fixing 
 
1. Need a loop to implement "re-try" in case of exception.
2. Need to fix a regular expression for the range of possible numbers.
3. To polish the code and get rid of millions of var in each function.
