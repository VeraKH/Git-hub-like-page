# JClass-page

Layout for this web-page was created from zero without a tamplate! As a visual sample I took Github user's profile page. So find the differences :) 

I also practice JavaScript on this page, and be carefull - you might find there annoying questions while clicking some links! Likely, nothing of that goes to the server - feel free to ignore it!
