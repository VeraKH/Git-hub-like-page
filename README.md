# JClass-page

Layout for this web-page was created from zero without any templates and only with HTML and CSS power. As a visual sample I took Github user's profile page. So find the differences :) 

I also practice JavaScript on this page, and be carefull - you might find there annoying questions and quizzes while clicking some links. Likely, nothing of that goes to the server - feel free to ignore it!
