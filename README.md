# JClass-page

Layout for this web-page was created from zero without any templates and only with the power of HTML and CSS. As a visual sample I took Github user's profile page. So find the differences :) 

I also practice JavaScript on this page, and be carefull - you might find there annoying questions and quizzes while clicking some links. Likely, nothing of that goes to the server - feel free to ignore it!  JavaScript code works only on index.html

#Problems solving and bugs fixing

1. Need a loop to implement "re-try" in case of  exception.
2. Need to fix Regular expression for the range of possible numbers
3. Probably need to create file.js to keep there scripts.
